# Furl - Secure File Sharing

A secure file sharing system that uses multi-layer encryption and client-side decryption to protect files.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### For Compiled Binary Users

```bash
# 1. Start the server
furl_server

# 2. Share a file
furl @youratsign document.pdf 1h

# 3. Share the generated URL and PIN with recipient
# Recipient enters PIN in web interface to decrypt and download
```

### For Dart Developers

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
dart pub get

# 2. Start the unified server
dart run bin/furl_server.dart

# 3. Share a file
dart run bin/furl.dart @youratsign document.pdf 1h

# 4. Share the generated URL and PIN with recipient
# Recipient enters PIN in web interface to decrypt and download
```

## Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Security**: Files are encrypted before upload, decrypted in recipient's browser
- **PIN Protection**: 9-character PIN protects encryption keys
- **Public Storage**: Uses public services (filebin.net) for encrypted file storage
- **atPlatform Integration**: Metadata stored securely on atPlatform
- **Client-Side Decryption**: All decryption happens in the browser for maximum privacy

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Server

#### Using Compiled Binary
```bash
# Start the unified server (default port 8080)
furl_server

# Or specify a custom port
furl_server --port 8090

# Or use command line options
furl_server --port 3000 --web-root public
```

#### Using Dart
```bash
# Start the unified server (default port 8080)
dart run bin/furl_server.dart

# Or specify a custom port
dart run bin/furl_server.dart 8090

# Or use command line options
dart run bin/furl_server.dart --port 3000 --web-root public
```

### 2. Upload a File

#### Using Compiled Binary
```bash
furl @youratSign path/to/file.txt 1h
```

#### Using Dart
```bash
dart run bin/furl.dart @youratSign path/to/file.txt 1h
```

This will:
- Encrypt the file with AES-256
- Generate a 9-character PIN
- Upload encrypted file to filebin.net
- Store encrypted metadata on atPlatform
- Display a URL and PIN for the recipient

### 3. Share with Recipient

Send the recipient:
1. **URL**: `http://localhost:8080/furl.html?atSign=@youratSign&key=_furl_xxxxx`
2. **PIN**: The 9-character code displayed during upload

### 4. Download and Decrypt

The recipient:
1. Opens the URL in their browser
2. Enters the PIN
3. Clicks "Download & Decrypt"
4. Gets the original file automatically decrypted

## How It Works

### Upload Process
```
Original File â†’ AES-256 Encrypt â†’ Upload to filebin.net
                     â†“
            AES Key â†’ PIN Encrypt â†’ Store on atPlatform
```

### Download Process
```
atPlatform â†’ Get Encrypted Metadata â†’ PIN Decrypt â†’ AES Key
filebin.net â†’ Get Encrypted File â†’ AES Decrypt â†’ Original File
```

### Security Model

1. **File Encryption**: Each file is encrypted with a unique 256-bit AES key
2. **Key Protection**: The AES key is encrypted using a PIN-derived key  
3. **Separation**: File data and encryption keys are stored separately
4. **Client-Side**: All decryption happens in the recipient's browser
5. **Zero-Knowledge**: Servers never see plaintext files or PINs

## Prerequisites

- Dart SDK
- Activated atSign (use `dart run at_activate --atsign @youratSign`)
- Network connectivity for atPlatform and filebin.net

## Command Line Usage

```bash
# Using compiled binary
furl @alice document.pdf 1h

# With verbose output  
furl @alice document.pdf 1h -v

# With quiet mode (no progress bars)
furl @alice document.pdf 1h -q

# Using Dart (for development)
dart run bin/furl.dart @alice document.pdf 1h

# With verbose output
dart run bin/furl.dart @alice document.pdf 1h -v

# Parameters:
# @alice       - Your atSign
# document.pdf - File to encrypt and share
# 1h           - TTL (1 hour, can use: 30s, 10m, 2h, 7d, or seconds)
# -v           - Verbose output (optional)
# -q           - Quiet mode - no progress bars (optional)
```

## Server Configuration

### Unified Server (bin/furl_server.dart)
- **Default Port**: 8080
- **Command Line Options**:
  - `--port <port>` - Specify server port
  - `--web-root <path>` - Specify web files directory (default: web)
  - `--help` - Show help message
- **API Endpoints** (prefixed with `/api/`):
  - `GET /api/atsign/{atSign}` - Resolve atSign to atServer
  - `GET /api/fetch/{atSign}/{keyName}` - Fetch encrypted metadata
  - `GET /api/download?url={url}` - Proxy file downloads
  - `GET /api/health` - Health check
- **Web Interface**:
  - `GET /` - Redirects to furl.html
  - `GET /furl.html` - File decryption interface
  - Static files served from web/ directory

## WebAssembly (WASM) High-Performance Decryption

For improved performance with large files, furl includes an optional WebAssembly (WASM) module written in Rust that provides hardware-accelerated AES-CTR decryption. This can improve decryption speeds by 2-10x for files larger than 10MB.

### WASM Prerequisites

To build and use the WASM module, you'll need:

1. **Rust**: Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2. **wasm-pack**: Install with `cargo install wasm-pack`
3. **Web server**: Required for loading WASM modules (CORS restrictions)

### Building the WASM Module

```bash
# Navigate to the WASM crypto directory
cd wasm-crypto

# Build the WASM module for web browsers
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg

# The generated files will be in wasm-crypto/pkg/
```

### WASM Integration

The web interface automatically detects and uses the WASM module if available:

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Falls back to WebCrypto API if WASM loading fails
2. **Chunked Processing**: Handles large files without memory issues
3. **Progress Callbacks**: Real-time progress updates during decryption
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic selection of fastest decryption method

### Performance Benefits

- **Small files (<1MB)**: Minimal difference, WebCrypto preferred
- **Medium files (1-10MB)**: 2-3x faster with WASM
- **Large files (>10MB)**: 5-10x faster with WASM
- **Memory efficient**: Chunked processing prevents browser crashes

### Development Notes

The WASM module source is in `wasm-crypto/src/lib.rs` and uses:
- `aes` crate for AES encryption primitives
- `ctr` crate for Counter mode implementation
- `wasm-bindgen` for JavaScript integration
- `js-sys` for browser API access

Build artifacts (wasm-crypto/pkg/) are excluded from the repository - you must build locally.

## Security Features

### Defense in Depth
- **Layer 1**: AES-256 file encryption
- **Layer 2**: PIN-protected key encryption  
- **Layer 3**: Separate storage of files and metadata
- **Layer 4**: Client-side decryption only

### Privacy Protection
- Servers never see plaintext files
- PINs never leave the recipient's browser
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Forward secrecy (unique keys per file)

### Access Control
- Requires both URL and PIN
- Time-limited access (TTL)
- Single-use URLs (can be configured)

## The Role of the PIN

The **PIN serves as a shared secret** that enables secure key exchange:

1. **Key Protection**: Protects the AES encryption key with an additional layer
2. **Zero-Knowledge**: PIN never leaves the recipient's browser  
3. **Access Control**: Requires both URL and PIN for file access
4. **Forward Secrecy**: Each file gets a unique PIN and AES key

### PIN Security Process

**Upload (Sender)**:
```
1. Generate random 9-char PIN
2. Derive key: PIN_Key = SHA256(PIN_bytes + Salt_bytes)  
3. Encrypt: Encrypted_AES_Key = AES-256(AES_Key, PIN_Key)
4. Store encrypted AES key + salt in atPlatform
5. Share URL + PIN with recipient
```

**Download (Recipient)**:
```
1. Enter PIN in browser
2. Derive same key: PIN_Key = SHA256(PIN_bytes + Salt_bytes)
3. Decrypt: AES_Key = AES-256-DECRYPT(Encrypted_AES_Key, PIN_Key)  
4. Use AES_Key to decrypt the downloaded file
```

## File Structure

```
bin/
  furl.dart          # Main CLI tool for encryption/upload
  furl_api.dart      # API server for atSign resolution and data proxy
  furl_web.dart      # Static web server
web/
  furl.html          # Client-side decryption interface  
lib/
  furl.dart          # Core library (if needed)
test/
  furl_test.dart     # Tests
SECURITY_DESIGN.md   # Detailed security analysis
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to authenticate"**: Make sure your atSign is activated
2. **"Could not fetch data"**: Ensure API server is running on correct port
3. **"Failed to download file"**: Check network connectivity to filebin.net
4. **"Invalid PIN"**: Ensure you're entering the exact 9-character PIN

### Debug Mode

Run with `-v` flag for verbose output:
```bash
# Using compiled binary
furl @alice file.txt 1h -v

# Using Dart
dart run bin/furl.dart @alice file.txt 1h -v
```

### Check Server Status

```bash
# Test unified server health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# Test web interface
curl http://localhost:8080/furl.html
```

## Security Considerations

- **PIN Strength**: 9 characters provide ~60 bits of entropy
- **Key Derivation**: Uses SHA-256 (could be enhanced with PBKDF2)
- **Transport**: Uses HTTPS for all external communications
- **Storage**: No sensitive data stored on servers

For detailed security analysis, see [SECURITY_DESIGN.md](SECURITY_DESIGN.md).

```bash
# Using compiled binary
furl @youratSign <file_path> <ttl>

# Using Dart
dart run bin/furl.dart @youratSign <file_path> <ttl>
```

Example:
```bash
# Using compiled binary
furl @alice document.pdf 1h

# Using Dart
dart run bin/furl.dart @alice document.pdf 1h
```

This will:
- Encrypt the file with AES-256
- Generate a 9-character PIN
- Upload the encrypted file
- Store secrets in atPlatform for 1 hour
- Print a URL for the recipient

### Receiving a File

1. Open the URL provided by sender in a web browser
2. Enter the 9-character PIN when prompted
3. Click "Download & Decrypt File"
4. The original file will be downloaded automatically

## Security Features

- **End-to-end encryption**: Files are encrypted before upload
- **Ephemeral keys**: AES keys are generated fresh for each file
- **PIN protection**: AES keys are encrypted with recipient's PIN
- **Automatic expiration**: Secrets expire after configured TTL
- **No persistent storage**: atPlatform only stores encrypted metadata

## Configuration

### atSign Setup

1. Update `bin/furl.dart` to use your atSign instead of `@cconstab`
2. Ensure your atSign keys are available at `~/.atsign/keys/`
3. Set `useMockAtClient = false` for production use

### File Hosting

The current implementation includes example code for uploading to file hosting services. You can:

1. Use transfer.sh (uncomment the relevant code)
2. Use filebin.net (requires API adjustments)
3. Implement your own file hosting solution

## Development

### Testing

The application includes a test mode that simulates file upload and atPlatform storage locally:

```bash
# Using compiled binary
furl @alice test_file.txt 10m

# Using Dart
dart run bin/furl.dart @alice test_file.txt 10m
```

Test the web interface:
```bash
cd web
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/?atSign=@cconstab&key=furl_1234567890
```
